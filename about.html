        <p class="about">
            I enjoy writing code and designing things. I have been developing games and websites for fun since I was 13 years old.
            Games are what I have the most fun with. I'm hugely interested in VR! I am currently working as an Associate Software Engineer
            at Odecee in Melbourne Australia doing mostly enterprise web development. My portfolio is
            at this point mostly fun side projects I hacked together for practice and learning. Please feel free to harshly criticize me so I
            can continue to learn and improve!
